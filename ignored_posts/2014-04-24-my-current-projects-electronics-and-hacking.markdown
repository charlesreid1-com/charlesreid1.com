_This is part 5 of a multi-part series._

I have a number of intersecting interests that involve 
electronics hacking, ham radio,
RFID, near-field communication, 
Ardunio and Android and Node and PhoneGap and Cordova, 
digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital communication,
the internet of things,
instrumentation, reality, learning, knowledge,
epistemology, life, death, and the universe.

Let's take this one step at a time.

## Electronics Hacking

I've been learning about writing apps with Node.js 
to run on Ardunio and Android, 
and I'm interested in exploring some 
photography (specifically, time-lapse photography) applications 
of these kinds of apps.

One of my current projects is to make an Arduino 
weather station, and eventually outfit it with
various other instruments, and communicate with it
via NFC (near-field communication), i.e., 
digital nodes communicating with radio transcievers.

### The Internet of Things

The Internet of Things is the idea that everyday objects 
existing in real space will also exist as nodes on the internet,
sort of like if your toaster had an IP address.

Smart thermostats are an example of a kind of internet of things thing,
because it exists in space, but also as an electronic device interacting with other electronic devices.

### Emergency Disaster Communications

I'd like to get involved in ham radio emergy communications efforts 
in San Francisco. While I'm not sure what kinds of applications these
various ideas and projects will have, I'm positive they'll have some.

Speaking of ham radio...

## Ham Radio

I've had a ham radio license since I was 7 (KC7DBU), 
so electronics and radio is certainly no mystery to me.
However, I studied chemical engineering, 
not electrical engineering, 
because there's something mysterious 
(and therefore difficult to grasp) 
about invisible electromagnetic forces.

(I mean, come on, get real. 110-meter waves? Seriously?)

I'm interested in figuring out how a mobile, handheld rig
could set up lines of communication with mobile equipment,
and communicate with repeaters on top of the Oakland hills.

This is the kind of equipment required to maintain lines of 
electronics communication when normal infrastructure fails.

## Deep Philosophical Stuff

Electronic instruments are cool, no matter what,
because they provide this deeply philosophical scenario
in which we are forced to confront the fallibility of 
our own senses, and wonder what kind of postprocessing
our brain is doing to our sensory data, 
and whether there is any way to hack our brains
to view the "raw feed" from our instruments.

Every once and a while, watching a machine learning algorithm
learn mechanically, I feel like I am a very complicated 
meat-bag calculator.

## Time-Lapse Photography 

One of my interests in applying some of these projects,
as mentioned above, is my interest in time-lapse photography.
I'd like to figure out some ways of transferring data
on the fly, to avoid storage limitations of cameras set up
for very long shot sequences, and to remotely control
time-lapse cameras, or control them with a script,
to programmatically rotate/move the cameras and/or adjust
brightness levels etc.

The Canon Hackers Developers Kit is a great way to take
old Canon point-and-shoot cameras, soup them up with all kinds 
of nifty features, then set them up to take some very 
high-quality time-lapse photos.
