_This is part 4 of a multi-part series._

This post summarizes the various writing-related projects 
I've got going on, and points to where everything is.

## The Writing I'm Doing

### CMR Blog

For some time now, I've hosted the [CMR blog](http://www.charlesmartinreid.com/wordpress/),
a Wordpress blog where I occasionally post essays, quotes, fragments from books I'm reading,
or photographs. The content is mostly non-technical, right-brain creative stuff.

### Octopress Blog

The Octopress blog is the left-brain complement to the right-brain CMR blog. 
The Octopress blog (which you're reading right now) is focused more on
technial topics - coding, chemical engineering, github projects, and so on.

The Octopress is a Github repository hosted by Github pages.

### The Cantera Book

This is actually a [chemical engineering](http://charlesreid1.github.io/blog/2014/04/22/my-current-projects-chemical-engineering-projects/)
writing project. I am assembling notes on the 
Cantera chemical kinetics library into a book,
which will be written in Markdown, rendered as
an Octopress blog, and hosted on Github pages.

### Short Stories

Currently, I don't write very many short stories, at all. 
But I do write the occasional short story, if the occasion arises.
For example, the Selected Shorts podcast had a short story contest,
to which I submitted a short story entitled _What did the President know, and when did he know it?_
that consisted entirely of questions.

## The Writing I Want To Do

There's a bit of writing that I'd like to do.

### Pop-Up Writing Sites

This basically entails the use of Github project pages 
to create pop-up sites with writing in/on them, 
and to share those site templates with others 
so that they can participate, collaborate, and expand
on those ideas.

This takes its inspiration in part from the 
chemical engineering Cantera Book project,
and from the ["I Use This" project](http://usesthis.com), which provides 
a template for users to customize their own versions of an
"I Use This" site, and have it hosted by Github pages.

The idea here would be similar, but with philosophy,
poetry, book quotes - whatever, basically.

### A Book

I want to write a book. Well, I guess that's why I'm writing [The Cantera Book](http://charlesreid1.github.com/cantera-book)!
