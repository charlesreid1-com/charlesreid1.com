_This is part 6 of a multi-part series._

One of the things I've been interested in for a long time 
is mnemonics and memorization.

One of my projects is to make a record of mnemonic techniques that work,
create an open-source digital version of my mnemonics on Github, 
and inspire others to start doing the same thing.

## Mnemonia

Go ahead and [get mnemonia](http://github.com/charlesreid1/mnemonia), 
the Github repository with all of my mnemonics in it.

It ain't much right now, but it is a work (er, project) in progress.
