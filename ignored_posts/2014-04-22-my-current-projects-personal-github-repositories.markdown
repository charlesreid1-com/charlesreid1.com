*This is part 1 of a multi-part series.*

This post is a rundown of some of my ongoing personal projects
that are hosted on Github.

## Apollo 11 Twitterbot

This project was fast, easy, and cool. A definite win 
for the power of Github and sharing with other people!

I used a natural language processor that 
[leonardr on Github](http://github.com/leonardr) wrote,
called [olipy](http://github.com/leonardr/olipy). 
I combined olipy's ability to learn from a source text,
and be able to generate random text in the same style, 
with one of the example source texts provided with 
olipy, the transcripts of all radio traffic during 
the Apollo 11 missions.

The down-and-dirty deets on the Python I wrote 
to make the Twitterbot: 
[Apollo 11 Space Junk Project on the CMR Wiki](http://charlesmartinreid.com/wiki/Apollo11Junk)

The result? See for yourself:

## Watergate Twitterbot

I've had a fascination with [Watergate](http://charlesmartinreid.com/wiki/Watergate) since I first read
[Rick Perlstein's Nixonland](http://charlesmartinreid.com/wiki/Nixonland).

In an effort to learn more about how to use Python for 
web content extraction, PDF to text, and natural language processing,
and to make all of that dovetail with my interest in Watergate,
I decided to write scripts to download, munge,and process 
the Watergate tape transcripts and related Watergate conversation transcripts.

This will all be fed, ultimately, to olipy, just like 
the Apollo 11 radio traffic transcripts,  
and hooked up to Twitter to make a Twitterbot that generates
random, fake Watergate tape transcripts.

## My Octopress Github Page

The page that you're reading right now is an [Octopress](http://octopress.org) blog that's 
hosted entirely by [Github](http://github.com)! This Octopress blog is actually
a static site that uses Jekyll and Ruby under the hood. The files are hosted by Github user pages.

The Octopress blog is at http://charlesreid1.github.io/

## D3

One of the perennial "do list" items is to learn D3. 
But every time I take a few days to become steeped in D3
and struggle with its immensely steep, ego-reducing learning curve, 
I realize how much time it will take to include even
the most basic level of complexity that I want out of
my widget, and I end up abandoning my efforts after 
a few days. Not much sticks, and it probably doesn't help
that I don't know (or, really, "get" as a language) Javascript.

But I've finally got a list of projects for which
D3 is, ultimately, absolutely the right choice. 
I plan on getting to know some people who are more 
familiar with D3 than I am, and getting them 
interested in some of the ideas I have, 
to enable some Github-based code collaborations.

(More details to come.)

## Pop-Up Blog Pages

One of the ideas that I'm interested in exploring is 
the really cool way that Github project pages make it 
possible to create small/minimalist repositories
that host a simple blog or a set of simple static
pages, and using that as a medium for spreading ideas.

For example, you could have a pop-up site describing
a few key concepts around [supercomputing epistemology](http://charlesmartinreid.com/dissertation),
or taking [Nietzsche and the Electric Nose](http://charlesmartinreid.com/wordpress/) one step further,
and so on.
