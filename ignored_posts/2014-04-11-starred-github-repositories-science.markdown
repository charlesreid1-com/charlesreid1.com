Last post, I decided to revisit some of the Github repositories I've starred.

Being a chemical engineer, my day-to-day coding activities
revolve around chemistry and physics, so a lot of the repositories
I am interested in are quantitative and/or science-related.

## The List

I'll start on the last list, from the bottom-up:

### Ember

* [speth/ember](http://github.com/speth/ember) - Quasi-1D Unsteady Flame Solver

Ember is maintained by Ray Speth, the primary maintainer of [Cantera](http://code.google.com/p/cantera'),
a super-handy library related to chemical reactions and thermodynamics.
Ember is an extension of Cantera's one-dimensional flame capabilities.

__Starred because of my interest in Cantera__

### iPython

* [ipython/ipython](http://github.com/ipython/ipython) - Official repository for IPython itself. Other repos in the IPython organization contain things like the website, documentation builds, etc.

While not technically a cience program, iPython stitches together
a fantastic environment called "pylab" that makes numpy and 
matplotlib available in a Matlab-style environment.

All of my interactive Python work is done in iPython. It is indispensable
for my day-to-day scientific programming.

__Starred for its remarkable utility__

### Scientific Python Lectures

* [jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures](http://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures) - Lectures on scientific computing with python, as IPython notebooks.

There are lots of lectures around Github, but this one is particularly
useful because of its coverage of all the core scientific libraries in Python:

* Scipy

* Numpy

* Matplotlib

* Sympy

* Existing C/Fortran code

It also covers high performance computing and version control. Wow! Excellent! 

__Starred because it taught me so much__ 

### Matplotlib Tools 

* [tonysyu/mpltools](http://github.com/tonysyu/mpltools) - Tools for Matplotlib

This repo fixes one of the annoyances I have about Matplotlib, 
one that I know has a solution (but a solution that would require
a lot of learning and a lot of effort, neither of which are 
interesting).

This library provides extensions of Matplotlib functionality so that
the plots, colors, etc [behave sanely and nicely and look pretty](http://tonysyu.github.io/mpltools/auto_examples/index.html).

__Starred because I liked the idea, downloaded it, and tried it out. It worked okay, but I didn't continue using it.__

### Chaco

* [enthought/chaco](http://github.com/enthought/chaco) - Chaco is a Python package for building interactive and custom 2-D plots.

I noticed Chaco when I was trying to figure out how to make interactive 
plots with Matplotlib. Enthought provides a whole nest of different packages,
including several plotting packages, and Chaco is particularly focused on
interactive 2D plots.

I haven't spent any time with it, which I plan on rectifying. (Part of the reason
I'm revisiting my starred repositories, after all!)

__Starred because it looks extremely interesting, and I need to spend some time with it.__


(To be continued...)
