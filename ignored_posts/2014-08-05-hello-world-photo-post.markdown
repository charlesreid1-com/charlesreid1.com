Recently, I decided to spruce up my Octopress blog and add a new post style: the photo post. 

This is basically a simple extension of the article class. The markdown file now has ```layout:photo``` 
and contains information about the photograph. This is used to render the photo post.

The photograph you see was taken in Lilac Alley, in San Francisco's Mission District, in July 2014.
