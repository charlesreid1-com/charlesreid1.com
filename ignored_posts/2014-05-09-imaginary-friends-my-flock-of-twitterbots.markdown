## Do androids dream of electric sheep?

Since I was young, I've been interested in science fiction.
And wrapped up with science fiction, inevitably, are robots -
robots are everywhere. The Star Wars droids, the artificial 
intelligence in Neuromancer, the stunning multitude of androids in 
the short stories of Philip Dick and Ray Bradbury and 
Isaac Asimov. 

You could say that robots have been on my mind for a while.

Given my interest in robots, I'm naturally keen to 
explore this concept of robots, robot autonomy,
robot intelligence, robot learning, even robot knowledge.
One of the best ways to implement bots is using Python.
This requires Python to interface with a 
web form or an API. And a common internet communication 
platform (which also has a convenient API)
is Twitter.

Of course, words and language are the most ubiquitous 
form of communication, and we live in a world with a 
caucophony of language.

But rather than freak out or get overwhelmed, 
I say, if you can't beat them, join them! 
If we're drowning in an ocean of noise, let's strap on
some lead weights and find out what the bottom
of the sea is like.

In this spirit, Twitterbots spawn streams of 
machine-generated chatter, adding 
machine-generated noise to human-generated noise.



## The Garden of Imaginary Friends 

In order to facilitate this end, I created the
Imaginary Friends github repo, where I keep a
(tiny) garden of imaginary friends.

Each Imaginary Friend is a Python Twitterbot.
Each Twitterbot has a different personality,
different quirks, different behaviors.

The Imaginary Friends Github Project page, which is 
at [http://charlesreid1.github.io/imaginary-friends](http://charlesreid1.github.io/imaginary-friends),
contains a comprehensive list of each of the 
Imaginary Friends in the garden.

The source code can be found
