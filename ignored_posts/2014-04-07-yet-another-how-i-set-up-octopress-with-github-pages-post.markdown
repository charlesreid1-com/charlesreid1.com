So there I was, up to my elbows in tabs, trying to figure out how Octopress works and how to 
get it set up with Github pages. It was complicated because every blog had a different starting point,
ending point, assumption of what had been installed, though no fault of the authors - to begin
at the common basis point of having nothing required installed on your computer, it takes a 
really, really long list of steps to get to a working Octopress installation. And each step
is fraught with unique difficulties.

That's why I documented every single last stinking step of my Octopress installation. I was using
Octopress to blog from a MacBook Pro running OS X Maverick and a [netbook](http://charlesmartinreid.com/wiki/Netbook) 
running Ubuntu Linux, version 12.04.

You can find all the documentation organized over at the [Octopress page on the CMR wiki](http://charlesmartinreid.com/wiki/Octopress). It has a
compartmentalized description of how to install Octopress.

No gory details here. Sorry!
