Open science movement, as far as I comprehend it,
focuses a lot on tools and introductions. One-day workshops
on pretty specific tools or techniques.

I haven't seen as much of the bigger-picture work
that's gone on to help these scientists and engineers
figure out how to integrate all of these tools into part 
of a regular workflow.

Slick techno-widgets that help make your science software 
more dazzling are great, but having a group of people 
on the same page with their tools - even if the tools are simple
- can make bigger waves.

This is what software tools are really supposed to do: 
help you be more productive and accomplish more science stuff.

Imagine if you planted the seeds of collaboration with 
scientific software tools at three or four different labs, 
or groups, or departments, at three or four different universities.
Suddenly, there is a technological hive of activity.
Having achieved a certain momentum, the hive 
takes on an inertia that attracts others.

Soon, researchers who join those research groups or 
students who take classes in those departments 
find it natural to collaborate on homeworks 
using code or to share research ideas using Latex and 
iPython notebooks and GitHub repositories instead of 
vague emails or infrequent face-to-face meetings with
remote collaborators.

The goal of focusing on scientific software and establishing an 
ecosystem around the tools is to transfer a couple of high-impact,
high-leverage tools that enable or improve the basic functions of research
(for example, Latex greatly enhances written scientific communication,
which is absolutely essential in scientific research, and as a tool
Latex can therefore have a huge impact). 

But it is also to stick around through the process of integrating those
high-impact tools into a normal workflow and supporting users who are 
doing so. Establishing a network of fellow software users
(at least some of whom are local) creates the necessary conditions to
build up the momentum of scientific software in academic communities.
