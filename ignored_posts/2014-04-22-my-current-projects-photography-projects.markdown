*This is part 3 of a multi-part series.*

This post gives a summary of all the 
various photography projects and techniques 
I've been exploring and using, and subjects
that I'm particularly interested in.

There are two categories here:
stuff I'm doing, and stuff I want to be doing.

## Stuff I'm Doing

Here is a list of the stuff I'm doing:
* Time Lapse Photography 
* Graffiti 
* Tilt Shift Photography 
* Night Imagery 
* Panoramics 
* Black and White 
* HDR

The time lapse photography is what I've 
spent the most time on lately, although
all in all I haven't spent much time on it 
at all, other than making a couple of 
time-lapse images with my iphone and tripod
in the evening or at lunch.

### Time Lapse Photography

I have made some time lapse photos with my 
iPhone, and have posted instructions 
[over on my wiki](http://charlesmartinreid.com/wiki/Timelapse_Movies).

### Graffiti

For some graffiti photos, check out [my Picasa page](http://picasaweb.google.com/charlesreid1)

### Tilt Shift Photography

For some tilt shift photos, check out [my Tiltshift album on Picasa](https://plus.google.com/photos/102767027761380756993/albums/5975536133571147441)

### Night Imagery

### Panoramics

### Black and White

### HDR




## Stuff I Want To Be Doing

### Robot Photography

I want to figure out how to use robots and robotic controls
in the process of taking photos. I want to set up some 
picture-taking robots to do interesting time lapse photos,
and/or collect and/or transmit information,
and/or make video and/or sound recordings.

### Remote Control Photography

Same idea as the robot photography, except I'd like to
learn what tools are required for a homebrew rig
to remotely view and control a DSLR or point-and-shoot
camera, and do so via radio control.

I know lots of drone rigs have remote control radios 
that transmit and receive video and control information,
so I'm sure it would be simple to do something 
similar with a DSLR camera and a ground-based setup.

If this could be set up on a rooftop, it could make 
for some very interesting time lapse videos.
If this could be set up on a rooftop with cheap
point-and-shoot cameras, you could rig together
4 or 8 of them, and make time-lapse panoramics.

### Very-Long-Time-Lapse Photography

Similar to above, with remote control photography,
except this would be with cheap cameras
(think webcam) and would take a picture once
every hour or 30 minutes for months on end.

I have some projects in the works that would use
an Arduino controller to record data and 
transmit it, remotely, to a listening program
running on a server, which would then use 
the transmitted information to 
construct a tweet or put the image in a folder
or whatever.
