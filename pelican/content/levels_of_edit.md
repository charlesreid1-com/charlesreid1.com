The following document gives an overview of the Doxuments "Levels of Technical Editing" system, 
which is a system employed in the process of technical editing to aid in estimating the complexity
of a document and the amount of time it will take to edit. 

The "Levels of Technical Editing" system was adopted from a similar "Levels of Edit" system employed by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), although the original Levels of Edit system is now old and outdated.



## Some Background: The JPL Levels of Edit Concept

In 1976, Van Buren and Buehler of JPL published a list of nine editing categories, grouped into five levels of edit.
The nine editing categories are:

* **Coordination**: manuscript handling, job monitoring and control                                                                                                   
* **Policy**: ensuring that required report elements are present, such as logos, title pages, covers, etc.                                                            
* **Integrity**: ensuring parts of a publication match                                                                                                                
* **Screening**: ensuring manuscript meets a minimal editorial standard, correcting unacceptable elements                                                             
* **Format**: ensuring conformity to specified format (typography, layout, figures, front matter, etc.)                                                               
* **Copy Clarification**: (ignore)                                                                                                                               
* **Mechanical** Style: ensuring consistent, appropriate styles following style guideline                                                                             
* **Language**: in-depth review of language of document, independent of mechanical or style concerns, with edits made for specific, identifiable reasons              
* **Substantive**: deals with the meaningful content of the publication, including coherence of individual parts, idealogical consistency, and conceptual parallelism 

First, we should acknowledge the usefulness of the levels of edit system. The idea of breaking down technical editing 
into its essential functions and categorizing those functions is extremely useful.

However, one of the first things you notice, looking through the list, is how outdated things sound. Technical editing,
printing methods, document formats, and the publishing process have all changed drastically from the time of the original
"Levels of Edit" publication.

While I wanted to use the "Levels of Edit" system, it was too outmoded to be useful. So I decided to retrofit 
the JPL "Levels of Edit" system to suit my own technical editing needs. 



## Doxuments Levels of Technical Editing

My next step was to come up with my own technical editing system: the Doxuments "Levels of Technical Editing" system. 
In trying to modify the JP "Levels of Edit" system, I found that many of the editing categories provided by JP were 
redundant or irrelevant. I threw a lot of it out the window.

I ended up with four levels of edit for the Doxuments "Levels of Technical Editing" system:

* Level 4: **Compositing and Layout Edits**: Ensuring manuscript elements are present and assembled, figures and tables are arranged and displayed correctly, and document layout is checked.
* Level 3: **Copyedits**: Ensuring spelling, grammar, mechanics of language, and style are all consistent and appropriate.
* Level 2: **Mathematics and Quantitative Edits**: Reviewing quantitative aspects of document, including mathematical equations, quantitative language, and qualitative trend descriptions, to ensure consistency and clarity.
* Level 1: **Logical and Technical Edits**: Reviewing the content of the document from a technical perspective, both to ensure consistency and correctness in technical details, and to ensure logical consistency in developing ideas and arguments.

I was able to use these four new levels of edit as a catch-all umbrella for any kind of technical editing activity
that I might end up doing. 



## Rubric: Received Manuscript Condition 

Once a level of edit has been decided upon for a manuscript, the next step is to classify the manuscript based on
the condition in which it was received. This is done using a rubic that grades several components of the manuscript
on a scale from 1 to 3. 

The rubric covers:
* Estimated language edits required
* Figures, equations, and tables
* Extraordinary editorial functions required
* Unusually difficult or time-consuming material
* Technical content editing

### Estimated Language Edits Required

The amount of language editing required depends greatly on 
the condition of the manuscript received.  
To accurately gauge the quality of language of received manuscripts, Doxuments uses the rubric
given below. Traits considered in the rubric are:

* Content/ideas

* Organization

* Vocabulary/word choice

* Sentence fluency

* Conventions

Descriptions of each of these traits, along with their corresponding scales from 1 to 3, are given below.

#### Content

* 1: Writing does not clearly communicate knowledge. The reader is left with questions.
* 2: Writing is purposeful and focused. Piece contains some details.
* 3: Writing is confident and clearly focused. It holds the attention of the reader. Relevant details enrich writing.

#### Organization

* 1: Writing is confused and loosely organized. Transitions are weak and closure is ineffective.
* 2: Writing includes strong beginning, middle, and end, with some transitions and good closure.
* 3: Writing includes a strong beginning middle, and end with clear transitions and a focused closure.

#### Vocabulary 

* 1: Writing exhibits unfamiliarity with common idioms or expressions. Manuscript has multiple problems with homonyms, malapropisms, typos, phonemes, or grammar problems.
* 2: Writing has occasional mistakes in spelling or typos, or an issue with a particular spelling.
* 3: Writing has been thoroughly spellchecked. Infrequent occurrence of errors.

#### Sentence Fluency

* 1: Run-on/fragment sentences. Limited variety in sentence structure.
* 2: Simple, compound, and complex sentences used.
* 3: Consistent variety of sentence structure throughout.

#### Conventions

* 1: Frequent errors between parts of speech, some errors in mechanics, limited evidence of spelling correction.
* 2: Mostly consistent agreement between parts of speech, few errors in mechanics.
* 3: Consistent agreement between parts of speech, no errors in mechanics.



### Figures, Equations, and Tables

Because figures, equations, and tables often require special consideration for formatting and layout of a document, including more figures, equations, and tables increases the complexity of the document and the editing time.

#### Figures

* 1: More than one of the following conditions apply: high density of figures in text; figures are low-quality; figures require processing; multiple issues with figures, figure presentation, or figure arrangement.
* 2: Only one of the above conditions apply.
* 3: None of the above conditions apply.

#### Equations

* 1: More than one of the following conditions apply: high density of equations in text; mathematics notation is inconsistent or requires checking; equations require transcription/retyping/reformatting.
* 2: Only one of the above conditions apply.
* 3: None of the above conditions apply.

#### Tables

* 1: More than one of the following conditions apply: high density of tables in text; multiple issues with tables, table formatting, table layouts; table cross-references require checking.
* 2: Only one of the above conditions apply.
* 3: None of the above conditions apply.



### Extraordinary Editorial Functions Required

* 1: Will definitely require researching references, significant writing (more than minor passages), locating missing items/tables/figures, collecting data and publications to providing author with material for decision-making
* 2: May require some of the above activities
* 3: Will not require the above activities



### Unusually Difficult/Time-Consuming Material

* 1: One or more of the following conditions apply: editing will require multiple iterations back-and-forth; copy written by non-native English speaker not familiar with idiomatic English usage; editing involves handwritten manuscripts (esp. mathematics)
* 2: 
* 3: None of above apply



### Technical Content Editing

* 1: One or more of the following conditions apply: multiple manuscript must be combined; manuscript length must be reduced on basis of technical content; accuracy of technical content must be verified; unit conversions to/from SI or English must be performed/checked; consistency in mathematical nomenclature/symbology must be checked and corrected.
* 2: 
* 3: None of above apply


## 

That concludes the overview of "Levels of Technical Editing," the rubric for technical editing that Doxuments uses.
By this point you should have a clear idea of the different components of the manuscript that Doxuments focuses on during 
the technical editing process, and what each Level of Edit will entail. 

I hope this helps you as you go through the process of editing your own technical manuscripts. 
And remember, you can always get in touch with Doxuments about getting more help with your technical editing.
